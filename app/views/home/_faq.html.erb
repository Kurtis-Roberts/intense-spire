        <span>Destinder is LFG for the elite. Say goodbye to blind and hopeful fireteam invites. As a Bungie authenticated and validated user, your stats will automatically be included with your post. We've also included individual and team stat lookups for various game types, just to make your life easier.</span>
        <span>Destinder started as a small project amongst some friends to learn to program. We ended up building in some sweet features and thought we would share! As fairly inexperienced developers, we are very open to any and all feedback! Please contact us with any thoughts you may have!</span>

      <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Many of our features can be found on other sites, but we've attempted to combine some of the most common ones in a single location. We've integrated LFG, stat lookups, player reputation rankings, progress checking, and many more convenient features - all with the purpose of helping you improve your Destiny experience.</span></div>
